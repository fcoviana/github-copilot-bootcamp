# Sample Apps

This folder contains sample apps that are used in the APL2007 training. Many of the exercise units use these sample apps as the starting point for coding projects.

These projects are also part of the challenges from the GitHub Copilot Bootcamp, designed to help you practice and improve your coding skills with the assistance of GitHub Copilot.
